# The Team
Hey there! Welcome to the AMP public team repo. The team grows. The atomic unit (people!) of the team change over time. New data is pulled into the collective organism that is the team. It's all just like your standard, complex code base!

With that preamble aside, meet the team...

1. **Mike McCormick** (General Manager/CEO)

2. **Jessamine Dana** (Senior Researcher)
- "Greetings! I am a senior qualitative researcher, anthropologist, and artist. ‘What did I make today?’ is the question that shapes my life. I hold a Ph.D. in Anthropology and an M.Phil in Material Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, both from the University of Oxford, England. My career has taken me from the UNESCO, Nepal, to large-scale R&D deployments at Intel Ireland's Digital Health Unit. With AMP, Artium, I help guide and execute our rigorous qualitative research program and translate nascent cultural and social movements into actionable product development insights. By investigating how the phenomenological and the digital are enmeshed, I believe we can become ethical and empowered contributors in our world's often uneven digital transformations. My specialities include field studies, ethnography, user research, design thinking, HCI/CHI, and participatory research. My passion is for innovating tools and approaches; I’m in it for the adventure!"

3. **Darren Sherrell** (Senior Researcher)
 - "Hello! I was a career scientist and engineer. A crazy cowboy scientist hired me to help him build a very complex piece of scientific equipment. After that, I was hooked and eventually got my Ph.D. in BioPhysics. I was among only a handful of scientists studying at the forefront of time-resolved, atomic resolution, protein dynamics. I hit a scientific career-high when my beamline was responsible for discovering 9 of the 21 protein structures of the original Covid strain. I've invented and built equipment and experiments. Artium is my most significant career change, and I'm excited to bring scientific rigor to the software development lifecycle. I've been a postman, bartender, carpenter and painted my fair share of elf houses amongst many other jobs."

4. **Adam Bedford** (Principal Product Manager)
 - "Hey there! I'm a lifelong 'maker', having taught myself to code as a kid, and have built and scaled a number of products, teams, and businesses throughout my career. After leading product development for several startups, I founded an edtech startup, JobTrack, that helped schools track and improve career outcomes, which was acquired in 2018. Recently, I built a small portfolio of ventures across a variety of industries ranging from education to e-commerce, acting as product/technical/go-to-market leader. I'm an avid tennis player and also love to read, travel and cook!"
